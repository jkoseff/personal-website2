		<div class="about_paragraph">
		<p>My name is Joanna Koseff. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington. I graduated from Roosevelt High School (located
		in Seattle, WA) in June 2012, and am currently in school at the University of Washington, studying Informatics. I would like to go into
		User Experience as a career.
		
		<p>I have always been interested in computers, as long as I can remember. When I was in middle school, I started
		to get an interest in web design when I saw my mom attempting to make a website using Adobe InDesign. I was so fascinated by it that I tried to
		make a website of my own. I got a few pages of the website designed, but then got busy with school and forgot about it (but hey - it was
		pretty good for a 7th grader, I'll tell ya that).
		
		<p>Then when I was in 12th grade I signed up for a semester-long web design class as an elective. In the class we 
		learned basic HTML and CSS code. I fell in love with it. I would spent countless hours (sometimes even 5 or 6 hours at a time) working on
		assignments for that class - even on weekends. I wouldn't stop until I finished the assignment. I enjoyed doing it, and it didn't feel like work
		to me. That's when, for the first time, I considered going into a career like that. Then that spring I happened to come across 
		Informatics while looking at the different majors available at the University of Washington. I read about it, and it seemed like a 
		perfect fit for me.</p>
